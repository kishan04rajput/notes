    <p>
      The DOM is not stored in any physical file or database. Instead, it’s a
      logical construct created by the browser when a web page is loaded. The
      browser parses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files of a web page, and then
      creates the DOM based on these files. The DOM represents the current state
      of the web page and can be manipulated using JavaScript.

    <div id="DOM_root"></div>

    <p>
      The Virtual DOM in React is stored entirely in memory. It’s a JavaScript
      object that lives in the memory space of your web browser or server (in
      the case of server-side rendering). The Virtual DOM isn’t stored as a
      visible part of your application; rather, it’s an internal data structure
      used by React for its diffing and rendering process.
